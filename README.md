## Description

This API was created in NestJS and works like a online store, as a `Manager` you can create, update and delete products, and as a `Client` you can see all the products that are allocated in the database. There are a lot of functions that you can play with, enjoy it!

* Install every dependency by running `yarn install`
* Create a `dotenv` file with the variables specified in [environment](#environment) section

## Dependencies
Listed on [package.json](/package.json)

## Schemas

The base of the API are `products` and `users`, these are the models that are handled

model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  name      String
  lastname  String
  username  String  @unique
  email     String  @unique
  password  String
  recovery  String? @unique @db.Uuid
  role      Role   @default(CLIENT)

  cart      Cart?

  orders    Order[]
  likesOnProducts LikesOnProducts[]

  @@map("user")
}
```

```
model Product {
  SKU         Int     @id @default(autoincrement())
  name        String @unique
  description String  @db.VarChar(200)
  price       Float
  stock       Int
  image       String?
  imageUrl    String?
  available   Boolean @default(true)

  cart      ProductsOnCarts[]
  orders    ProductsOnOrders[]
  likesOnProducts LikesOnProducts[]

  category  Category @relation(fields: [categoryId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  categoryId Int @map("category_id")

  @@map("product")
}
```

You can see all the implementations and relations in the [prisma schema](./prisma/schema.prisma)

## Endpoints

You can test all the functionalities with this [endpoints](./src/docs/nestjs-challenge.json), also if you're running locally, vist [this link](http://localhost:3000/api#)

## Extra points
